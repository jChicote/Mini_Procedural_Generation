<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a mini project undertaken by myself to study the development of procedural generation in games and for other potential application. This is strictly made to be developed on Desktop/PC. 

The project undergoes development of both active and offline procedural generation. Additionally, further work will experiment with development on minecraft-like procedural generation and other procedural generation techniques for games programming. Development of different generation areas will utilise either single threaded or multi-threaded applications through both traditional programming and compute shaders.
